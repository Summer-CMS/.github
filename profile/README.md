<h3>What is Summer CMS ?</h3>

We love the World Wide Web, it's constantly changing and evolving everyday with new and exciting features, specifications and API's. Many webmasters choose to use content management system (CMS) / content management framework's (CMF) to build their websites and applications. Summer CMS is different from traditional web content management systems and frameworks. It pushes the boundaries of web standards, frameworks and technology, what is limited to another system is not limited here.
