# Summer CMS - Open Source Community Guidelines

We recognize and celebrate the creativity and collaboration of open source contributors and the diversity of skills, experiences, cultures and opinions they bring to projects and communities they participate in.

Every one of our open source Summer CMS modules, projects and communities are inclusive environments, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race,
age, religion, or similar personal characteristic.

We value diverse opinions, but we value respectful behavior more!

Respectful behavior includes:

- Being considerate, kind, constructive and helpful.

- Not engaging in demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, sexualized, or physically threatening behavior, speech and imagery.

- Not engaging in unwanted physical contact.

Some Summer CMS open source projects **may adopt** an explicit project code of conduct, which may have additional detailed expectations for participants. Most of those projects will use our **modified Contributor Covenant**.

## Our Standards

Summer CMS is dedicated to providing a positive conference experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being kind to others
- Behaving professionally
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment of conference participants in any form
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Violent threats or language directed against another person
- Sexual language and imagery in any conference venue, including talks
- Insults or put downs
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- Excessive swearing
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Unwelcome physical contact
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## Resolve peacefully

We do not believe that all conflict is necessarily bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yields positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute.

If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.

## Reporting problems

Some Summer CMS open source projects may adopt a project-specific code of conduct. In those cases, a project member will be identified as the Project Steward, who will receive and handle reports of code of conduct violations. In the event that a project hasn't identified a Project Steward, you can report problems by contacting us.

We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response. We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from the project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without
notice.

### When To Report

Please report all incidents where someone has engaged in behavior that is potentially illegal or makes you or someone else feel unsafe, unwelcome or uncomfortable as further explained in the Community [Participation](PARTICIPATION.md) Guidelines.

### How to Give a Report

To report an individual or a Summer CMS team member, please contact us and we'll discuss it in private.

## What happens after the report is filed

### Investigation

Reports are handled discretely and privately, and will only be shared with the people who can investigate, respond, and advise. As part of this investigation, it may be necessary for some information to be disclosed to others, for example, to key stakeholders administering communities or events, witnesses, and the wrongdoers.

### Correspondence

All reports are reviewed and responded to based on the nature of the report and we try to provide reasonably timed updates as part of open investigations.

### Redress

When an investigation is complete, to the extent the wrongdoer is subject to Summer CMS's control, appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation.

### No Retaliation

Summer CMS does not tolerate retaliation against people who report concerns under the Community [Participation](PARTICIPATION.md) Guidelines in good faith. Acts of retaliation should be reported in the same process as described above.
